# Utveckling för Androidplattformar 25 yhp - 2021 VT

- **ShakeAcceleration** - Shake, you'll create your first app: 
  - The app must have at least one Activity and a fragment. Then you must trigger how you can use the data from your mobile accelerator to show something in your app. 
  - *Bonus goal* : 
    - that you should with the help of the data from the accelerator rotate an image in your app


- **LifeCycle** - you should create an app that has at least 3 Activities: 
  - First Activity: A login page- This should be remembered if you are already logged in and go on to the next Activity if you are logged in
  - Second Activity: a "form" that allows the user to fill in 5 different types of data and can send the data to the next Activity
  - Third Activity: should be able to save and display current saved data if it is there.
  - You should also create a menu (optional type) that can navigate all Activities
  - *Bonus goal* :
    - that you save the things you filled in if you were to pause (hint: SavedInstanceState)
    - that you can save data even when closing the app (hint: SharedPreferences)


- **WeatherService** - Create an app using https://openweathermap.org/ (You need to create an account for an API key) 
    - With the API you will create a Service that creates different notifications based on where the value is based on what you enter in the app
    - *Bonus goal* :
      - You create a function that checks the weather at a time interval (hint: AlarmManager)
      - Set up that the weather data received can be saved to check later (Hint SQLite)
  

- **Projekt** - Anime Hub: 
    - Anime Hub is an anime wiki application inspired by MyAnimeList and uses [jikan.moe](https://jikan.moe/) which is an "open-source PHP & REST API". Jikan.moa scrapes / analyzes the website, [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/), to meet the need for an API.
    - *Functionality* :
      - Search by title
      - Anime details page
      - Related genre list, clickable for genre search
      - Clickable search options from menu: Ongoing, Upcoming and Most Popular
      - Add anime to favorite list
      - View favorite list
      - Remove anime from favorite list
      - Delete favorite list
