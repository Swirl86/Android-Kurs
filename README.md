- **ShakeAcceleration** - Shake, you'll create your first app: 
  - The app must have at least one Activity and a fragment. Then you must trigger how you can use the data from your mobile accelerator to show something in your app. 
  - *Bonus goal* : 
    - that you should with the help of the data from the accelerator rotate an image in your app


- **LifeCycle** - you should create an app that has at least 3 Activities: 
  - First Activity: A login page- This should be remembered if you are already logged in and go on to the next Activity if you are logged in
  - Second Activity: a "form" that allows the user to fill in 5 different types of data and can send the data to the next Activity
  - Third Activity: should be able to save and display current saved data if it is there.
  - You should also create a menu (optional type) that can navigate all Activities
  - *Bonus goal* :
    - that you save the things you filled in if you were to pause (hint: SavedInstanceState)
    - that you can save data even when closing the app (hint: SharedPreferences)
